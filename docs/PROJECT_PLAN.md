# Waugzee Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Waugzee** is a vinyl play and cleaning logging application that helps users track when they play and clean their vinyl records. The app leverages users' existing Discogs collections as the data source and implements a client-as-proxy architecture for distributed API rate limiting. This represents a complete rewrite of the Kleio system, focusing on minimal viable features with modern infrastructure and clean architecture.

## Migration Strategy: Fresh Start Approach

After analyzing both the current Kleio (in messy migration state) and the robust LoadTest project architecture, we've chosen to **start completely fresh** rather than attempt to migrate the existing codebase. This approach provides:

- **Clean Architecture**: Proven patterns from day one
- **Modern Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + Redis, proper caching, production-ready setup
- **Scalability**: Multi-user ready, proper authentication, interface-based design
- **Better Tooling**: Tilt orchestration, comprehensive testing, hot reloading
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns, dependency injection, clean code patterns

## Architecture Comparison

### Original Kleio Issues

- No proper user management (single-user)
- Basic migration system with manual SQL files
- Limited development tooling (basic Air setup)
- Monolithic controller pattern
- No caching layer
- Manual authentication handling

### Waugzee Advantages

- PostgreSQL + Valkey (Redis) dual database architecture
- Multi-user ready with Zitadel OIDC integration
- GORM with proper migrations and UUID7 primary keys
- Tilt orchestration with hot reloading and comprehensive tooling
- Repository pattern with dependency injection
- Proper caching strategies
- JWT-based authentication with session management
