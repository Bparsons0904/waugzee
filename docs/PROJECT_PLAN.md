# Waugzee Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Waugzee** is a complete rewrite of the Kleio vinyl record collection management system, built using proven architectural patterns from the Vim project. This represents a fresh start with modern infrastructure, clean architecture, and scalable design patterns.

## Migration Strategy: Fresh Start Approach

After analyzing both the current Kleio (in messy migration state) and the robust Vim project architecture, we've chosen to **start completely fresh** rather than attempt to migrate the existing codebase. This approach provides:

- **Clean Architecture**: Proven patterns from day one
- **Modern Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + Redis, proper caching, production-ready setup
- **Scalability**: Multi-user ready, proper authentication, interface-based design
- **Better Tooling**: Tilt orchestration, comprehensive testing, hot reloading
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns, dependency injection, clean code patterns

## Architecture Comparison

### Original Kleio Issues

- SQLite with direct SQL queries
- No proper user management (single-user)
- Basic migration system with manual SQL files
- Limited development tooling (basic Air setup)
- Monolithic controller pattern
- No caching layer
- Manual authentication handling

### Waugzee Advantages (Vim-Based)

- PostgreSQL + Valkey (Redis) dual database architecture
- Multi-user ready with Zitadel OIDC integration
- GORM with proper migrations and UUID7 primary keys
- Tilt orchestration with hot reloading and comprehensive tooling
- Repository pattern with dependency injection
- Proper caching strategies
- JWT-based authentication with session management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 7: Data Migration & Deployment

**Goals**: Migrate existing data and deploy to production

**Tasks**:

- Create data migration scripts (SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL)
- Implement data validation and integrity checks
- Set up production deployment pipeline
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Performance testing and optimization

**Deliverables**:

- Data migration tools
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.25+
- **Framework**: Fiber v2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Cache**: Valkey (Redis-compatible)
- **ORM**: GORM with UUID7 primary keys
- **Authentication**: Zitadel OIDC
- **Architecture**: Repository pattern with dependency injection

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: SolidJS with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: SCSS with CSS Modules
- **State Management**: Solid Query + Context API
- **Authentication**: OIDC flow integration
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration

### Infrastructure

- **Development**: Tilt orchestration with Docker
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations
- **Cache**: Valkey for sessions and temporary data
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with proper networking

## Key Design Decisions

### Database Architecture

- **PostgreSQL over SQLite**: Better concurrency, proper relationships, production-ready
- **UUID7 Primary Keys**: Better for distributed systems, sortable UUIDs
- **Dual Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL for persistent data, Valkey for cache/sessions
- **GORM Migrations**: Type-safe migrations, better than raw SQL

### Authentication Strategy

- **Zitadel OIDC**: Enterprise-grade authentication, multi-tenant ready
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication, WebSocket compatible
- **Session Management**: Valkey-based sessions for performance

### Architecture Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data access logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Testable, maintainable code
- **Interface-Based Design**: Easy mocking and testing
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns throughout

## Development Environment

### Required Tools

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Tilt (for orchestration)
- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL client tools

### Development Workflow

1. `tilt up` - Start entire development environment
2. Access Tilt dashboard at http://localhost:10350
3. Frontend at http://localhost:3020
4. Backend API at http://localhost:8288
5. Hot reloading for both frontend and backend

### Key Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
tilt up

# Run tests
tilt trigger server-tests
tilt trigger client-tests

# Run linting
tilt trigger server-lint
tilt trigger client-lint

# Database operations
